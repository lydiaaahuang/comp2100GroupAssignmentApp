## Team Meeting [2] - Week [7] - [24/4/22] (8pm - 9pm)
**Absent:** n/a
**Lead/scribe:** Emily

## Meeting Minutes

### Expanding on why we want a tutor app
- bridge gap for disadvantage students
- shift intent from finding a tutor to making it more humanitarian 
- we can do tutoring for rural areas, because rural education isnâ€™t as good at city education??? 
- Or provide more advanced courses or further learning?
- maybe start implementing basic app first before implementing the further features

### basic app 
- login in, sign up , search 
- database 
- search

### intro page 
- login button to page
- sign up to page -> as tutor or student
- login in page ->
- do we pull data from 2 bases or 1??
  - 2 different log ins - 1 for student and 1 for student
  - 2 databases 1 for tutor 1 for student
  - 1 log in  
    - smoother if have default homepage (student) and if not move to tutor 
    - but if our target demographic is rural than it would be mostly student or mostly tutor not really both a student and a tutor 
    - have 2 separate log ins for student and tutor 
- create 2 accounts if you want to be a student and a tutor 
  - justify as expect target demographic to be either not both accounts
  - 
- use a design pattern!!!
  - maybe implement abstract person class who student and tutor classes implements/ inherits 

### student page 
- search only for tutors 
- no ranking 
- list view  of tutor in your area 
- or use location to find in area
- list view ; firebase 
  - refresh what tutors there are
  - scrollable list view 
- for search = new page 
- ranking view 
  - of different tutors 
  - sort by subject, area etc. 
  - based on student feedback 
- feedback on tutor 

### tutor page
- edit profile and chat 
- profile (#2)
  - search for other tutors (later)
- chat to chat with students
  - student has to text them first 

### search page
- new view with filter conditions e.g. subject , area, availability 

### app names 
- tutorbnb 
  - inspired by airbnb 
  - but bnb stands for bed and bath = bad name 
- findmytutor 
- will need to do some more thinking
- 

### misc
- make a design skeleton -> see resources/images
- could we do front end and back end stuff simultaneously?
- rohan would prefer back end stuff rather than front end stuff
- rohan's app design is in images folder 

### delegation

- sung-jae to do number 4
- lydia and emily to front-end making the different page views
