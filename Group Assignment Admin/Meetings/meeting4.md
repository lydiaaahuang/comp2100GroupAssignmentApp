## Meeting Minutes

### AVL Tree Implementation 

**Rohan**: I will implement a AVl tree such that we will not have to querey directly from some database. This will make our app faster. The node will contain a String which will be the course name or the tutor name. The value will be boolean; `TRUE` if it's a course and `FALSE` if it's not a course This will make things a lot easier. Two trees will be required. One for strings and one for ints. 

Also when a user searches for a tutor by hourly rate, the results should return everything less than or equal to the input rate. 

### Parser/Tokenizer 

**Rohan**: I will try to include the hyphen stuff because it would be useful. However, it will be very difficult. 

**Rohan**: I require some assistance with writing tests. 

**Lydia:** I will help if I have time 

**SungJae**: Same. 

### Data Stream Simulation 

**SungJae**: The following describes my planned implementation of the simulated data stream. 

We will essentially simulate a tutor changing/setting their activity status. I will implement a file reading method. 

My initial idea of simulating a live activity log was rejected by my tutor. 

What to do following the implementation will be subject to discussion. 

**Rohan**: There should also be a simulation of the courses that the tutor teaches and also student's details. ie. what they're studying, what year they're in. Online status for students don't matter. The only thing that really changes is what courses they wanted to be tutored in. 

**SungJae**: Basically any app implementations that require some sort of user input/change following account creation should be simulated. 

### Front End 

**Emily**: I have implemented the navigation bar. 

**Lydia**: That's all for our upate for this meeting.
