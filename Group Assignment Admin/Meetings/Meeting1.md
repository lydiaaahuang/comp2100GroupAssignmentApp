Social good ideas

Mark good tourist locations, places to visit
- Mark locations you want to visit or suggest on a map
- Can create a friends map where you can all add locations/places you want to see/visit 
Or have a public map for everyone to see 
Cons: need to implement our own map system, how to do a global map vs one on one map

Report potholes on a map 
- Can message the council about the pothole issue
- Post pictures of the pothole and then people can like the image if they agree that it needs to be fixed etc 
Cons: need to implement our own map system 

Sustainability 
- People can search for a company and we will give them a rating on sustainability 
- Therefore people can make more sustainable choices when purchasing items
Cons: Cant implement a peer to peer messaging (as this is a feature we are really interested in implementing) 

Find my tutor
- Volunteer tutor app
- BackEnd.Tutor and student separate sign up
- Has search (for tutor/ for student) and peer to peer function (tutor to student)
- Volunteer; maybe the level of education isn't as great if the tutors are volunteers only? 
- Tutors have to send qualifications 
- Ranking, review tutors, different weighting in skills, gpa, atar, knowledge, teaching, on time etc
- Can have a location/map for tutors in area.
