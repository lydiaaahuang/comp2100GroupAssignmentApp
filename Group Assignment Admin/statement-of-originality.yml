declaration: >-
  I declare that everything I have submitted in this assignment is entirely our
  own work, with the following exceptions:


# add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't collaborated with anyone outside your group)
collaboration:
  - name: COMP2100 Lab 8
    comment: In particular used basic implementation of real time database in firebase from instructions in this lab as the basis of adding things to the database. The basic data stream implementation was used as well. 
  - name: COMP2100 Lab 4
    comment: Basic implementation of the AVL tree was used as a guide to develop the AVL Tree in this assignment. The general structure was followed but extended by adding extra parameters to the constructors (hence modifying the nodes) with most methods being modified and multiple extra methods being added.
  - name: COMP2100 Lab 7
    comment: Basic implementation of the Tokenizer and Parser was used a guide to develop the tokenizer and parser used in this assignment. The general structure was followed but extended by modifying the grammar and tokenizer for the uses of this assignment.
